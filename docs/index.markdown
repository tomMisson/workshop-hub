# Howdy! 🤠 Welcome to my workshops 

Hi there! if you're here then you are either wanting to find my workshop content (its on the left btw) or you're here because you're Tom, in which case 👋 Hi Tom. Otherwise, I am really confused what else brings you here... Please let me know! 

For the Twilio content, I am a [Twilio Champion](https://www.twilio.com/champions) so if you have any questions, feel free to get in touch!
